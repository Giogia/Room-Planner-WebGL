/**
 * ModelGraft
 *
 * This is a coordination primitive between a scene graph as represented by the
 * output for Three.js' GLTFLoader and a counterpart 3DOM facade. Since this is
 * the Three.js-specific implementation of the facade, the input is a GLTF-like
 * object whose keys refer to Three.js-specific constructs (e.g., gltf.scene is
 * a THREE.Scene).
 *
 * When created, the ModelGraft produces a Model that can be traversed and
 * manipulated to mutate the Three.js scene graph synchronously (but
 * indirectly). The benefit of this is that mutations to the Three.js scene can
 * be performed in a Three.js-agnostic fashion that is potentially portable to
 * alternative rendering backends.
 *
 * The scene graph representation produced by the ModelGraft is designed to
 * match the structures described in the glTF 2.0 spec as closely as possible.
 * Where there are deviations, it is usually for the purpose of making
 * synchronization easier, or else for ergonomics. For example, in glTF 2.0, the
 * graph is a series of flat arrays where nodes cross-reference each other by
 * index to represent hierarchy, but in a Model nodes have array members
 * containing refrences to their hierarchical children.
 *
 * An important goal of ModelGraft is to enable a scene in one JavaScript
 * context to be manipulated by script in a remote context, such as a distant
 * worker thread or even a different process. So, every node in the graph
 * is able to be serialized, and the serialized form includes an ID that is
 * locally unique to the ModelGraft instance that the node came from so that
 * the remote context can refer back to it. A ModelGraft can be thought of as
 * the host execution context counterpart to the ModelKernel in the scene graph
 * execution context.
