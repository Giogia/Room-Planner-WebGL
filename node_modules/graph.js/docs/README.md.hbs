*formerly known as js-graph*

`graph.js` is a javascript library for storing arbitrary data in mathematical (di)graphs,
as well as traversing and analyzing them in various ways. It was originally created to
track dependencies between options and modules. It is written in ECMAScript 6, but
auto-generated ECMAScript 5 versions are shipped with it.

Feedback of any kind (questions, issues, pull requests) is greatly appreciated.


Installing graph.js
-------------------

When running in an ECMAScript 5 environment, this library depends on the
[Babel ES6 polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill).
For your convenience, a standalone version of graph.js is available,
which has the polyfill already baked in.

graph.js is available from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org) and [Bower](http://bower.io):

```shell
npm install graph.js --save
```

```shell
bower install graph.js --save
```

The Babel polyfill is [not distributed through Bower](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/315).
So Bower users have to either use the standalone version of graph.js, or get the polyfill from
someplace else, like NPM.


Loading graph.js
----------------

The graph.js library supports all popular module systems:
[ECMAScript 6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import),
CommonJS ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org),
          [IO.js](https://iojs.org),
          [browserify](http://browserify.org),
          [webpack](http://webpack.github.io)),
AMD ([RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)),
and good old-fashioned [HTML script tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script).

```javascript
import Graph from 'graph.js'; // the ES6 version is default
// use Graph
```

```javascript
var Graph = require('graph.js/dist/graph.full.js');
// use Graph
```

```javascript
requirejs(['graph.js/dist/graph.full.js'], function (Graph) {
    // use Graph
});
```

```html
<script src="graph.js/dist/graph.full.js"></script>
<script>
    // use Graph
</script>
```

The `dist` directory offers different files for use in different circumstances.
Use the following table to determine which file to use in your situation.

| File                                    | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `graph.es6.js`                          | for use in an ECMAScript 6 context, e.g., a modern browser or transpiler                    |
| `graph.js`,<br>`graph.min.js`           | requires you to load the [Babel polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) yourself |
| `graph.full.js`,<br>`graph.full.min.js` | already includes the Babel polyfill                                                         |

If you don't know which you need, you probably want `graph.full.js`, because it will work out-of-the-box.
But it is generally more elegant to load the polyfill yourself, especially if you use other libraries that
also depend on it.
